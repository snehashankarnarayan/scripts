# ENVIRONMENT
# ===============================================================
# The DISPLAY variable tells programs which display to use.
# This mainly affects programs running on the X server.
# However, when I use screen then I am usually using a terminal -
# and programs do not need to contact the X server.
# This results in programs waiting for some timeout when
# they start up - and this just keeps getting in my way.

# some notes on COLOR before explaining its use in
# the commands caption, hardstatus, and sorendition.
#
# COLOR:  colors codes are combinations of
# [attribute modifier] [color description]
# the manual talks of "attribute/color modifiers".
# see the manual, section "STRING ESCAPES".
#
# Color table:
# 0 Black             .    leave color unchanged
# 1 Red               b    blue
# 2 Green             c    cyan
# 3 Brown / yellow    d    default color
# 4 Blue              g    green           b    bold
# 5 Purple            k    blacK           B    blinking
# 6 Cyan              m    magenta         d    dim
# 7 White             r    red             r    reverse
# 8 unused/illegal    w    white           s    standout
# 9 transparent       y    yellow          u    underline
#
# note: "dim" is not mentioned in the manual.
#
# ===========================================
# CAPTION - shows a "caption" for the window.
# ===========================================
# a "caption" is another line which can show information -
# in addition to the hardstatus line.
#
# use caption to show window list:
# caption always "%{= kc}%?%-Lw%?%{= kY}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{= kc}%?%+Lw%?"
#
# caption always '%{= wb}%50=%n%f %t%{= wb} %c:%s, %d/%m/%Y'
# this basically just shows the current window number and title
# on its own; the "%50=" displays it in the middle of the line.
#
# caption always "%>%{wk}%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{wk}%?%+Lw%?%<"
# caption always "%-Lw%{= BW}%50>%n%f* %t%{-}%+Lw%< %=%H %c:%s  %d/%m/%Y "
# caption always "%?%F%{.RW}%?%3n %t%? [%h]%?"
# caption always "%{rk}%H %{gk}%c %{yk}%M%d %{wk}%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{wk}%?%+Lw%?"
# caption always "%{bk}%h %{rk}%?%-Lw%?%{rk}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{rk}%?%+Lw%?"
# 
# caption always "%{kd}%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{kw}%?%+Lw%?"
#
# "push right border: current time with seconds and current date"
# caption always "%=%c:%s %Y-%m-%d"
# ===============================================================
#
# ===============================
# Hardstatus Line and sorendition
# ===============================
# hardstatus: Always show the window list in the last line:
#hardstatus alwayslastline "%w"
#hardstatus alwayslastline "%H %w"
#
# use 'L' between '%' and 'w' to show the flags, too1
#
# example by Adam Spiers <gnu-screen@adamspiers.org> :
# *without* colors:
# hardstatus alwayslastline "%?%-Lw%?%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%?%+Lw%?"
# *with* colors:
 #hardstatus alwayslastline "%?%{yk}%-Lw%?%{wb}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%?%{yk}%+Lw%?"
#
# This will show the current time and today's date in YYmmdd, too:
# hardstatus alwayslastline " %c | %Y%m%d |  %w"
#
# This will show today's date in mmdd and the current time, too:
# hardstatus alwayslastline " %m%d %c |  %w"
#
# combining all of these gives:
# hardstatus alwayslastline "%{rw}%H%{wk}|%c|%M%d|%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{wk}%?%+Lw%?"
#
# this uses a black background foreverything execpt for
# the current window which is show on a white background.
# hostname in red, clock in green, date in yellow:
# hardstatus alwayslastline "%{rk}%H %{gk}%c %{yk}%M%d %{wk}%?%-Lw%?%{bw}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{wk}%?%+Lw%?"
#hardstatus alwayslastline "%{+b kg}%t:%{-b kk}% %{kb}%?%-Lw%?%{+b rk}[%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?]%{-b kb}%?%+Lw%?"

#hardstatus alwayslastline "%{kb}%?%-Lw%?%{+b ry}[%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?]%{-b kb}%?%+Lw%?"

# original line:
hardstatus alwayslastline "%{kw}%?%-Lw%?%{+b wr}[%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?]%{-b kw}%?%+Lw%? %=%c:%s %Y-%m-%d"
#
# hardstatus alwayslastline "%{rk}host: %H %33=%{yk}date: %M%d %66=%{gk}time: %c:%s%="
#
# hardstatus alwayslastline "%{rk}host: %H %33=%{yk}date: %M%d %66=%{gk}time: %c%="
#
# no "host:", "date:", or "time:" here.
# instead, the info gets placed at 16%, 50%, and 80% so that it is
# placed soemwhat in the middle of each of the three panels.
# hardstatus alwayslastline "%{RY}%16=%H %33=%{YR}%50=%M%d %66=%{Gb}%80=%c%="
#
# 2003-08-19
# insert the main url of the screen pages:
#hardstatus alwayslastline "%{dd}%t%20=%{dd}%35=%{%dd}host: %H %65=%{ddb}%M%d %90=%{ddb}%C%a%="
#hardstatus alwayslastline "%{dd}%h%20=%{dd}%35=%{%dd}host: %H %65=%{ddb}%M%d %90=%{ddb}%C%a%="
#
# 2003-03-26
# use the hardstatus line to show the
# latest news of the IT ticker at heise.de:
# backtick 1 127 0 heise
# hardstatus alwayslastline "%{bw}%1`%= "
#
# note: the use of ANSI color sequences is deprecated.
#       please upgrade to (at least) screen 3.9.13
#       so you can make use of the color letters/names!
#
# "sorendition": set the colors for
# the "messages" and "text marking"
# (ie text you mark in copy mode):
#
# sorendition 10 99 # default!
# sorendition 02 40 # green  on black
# sorendition 02 34 # yellow on blue
# sorendition    rw # red    on white
#  sorendition    kG # black  on bold green

# ============================
# Password
# ============================
# # # password SZnBqiqMtfa6k
# WARNING!!  Do NOT remove the comment
# if you don't know what this does!
# read on:
# this commands sets the *internal*
# password for the screen session.
# if this is set then a "lock" command will
# only let you in to the session after you
# enter the user's account password and then
# also the internal password for that session.
# so this gives additional safety.
# but if you forget the internal password
# then you can also forget about the session - ok?!
#
# ===============================================================
# Messages
# ===============================================================
# There are two kinds of messages:  "activity" and "bell"
# They are also the names of the commands that set the
# respective messages.  In every message there can be "meta
# strings" which are replaced by values.  A meta string starts
# with a percent sign and is then followed by one
# of the following letters: aAcCdDfFhHlmMnstuwWyY
# The meta strings usually refer to the current
# date and time or to a window title or number.
# There are also some specials like embedded branches (with %?),
# color codes (with %{xy}) and padding (with %=, %<, %>).
# you can find their description in the manual in section
# "STRING ESCAPES":
#  %%      percent sign (the escape character itself)
#  %a      either 'am' or 'pm' - according to the current time
#  %A      either 'AM' or 'PM' - according to the current time
#  %c      current time HH:MM in 24h format
#  %C      current time HH:MM in 12h format
#  %d      day number - number of current day
#  %D      Day's name - the weekday name of the current day
#  %f      flags of the window
#  %F      sets %? to true if the window has the focus
#  %h      hardstatus of the window
#  %H      hostname of the system
#  %l      current load of the system
#  %m      month number
#  %M      month name
#  %n      window number
#  %s      seconds
#  %t      window title
#  %u      all other users on this window
#  %w      all window numbers and names.
#  %-w     all window numbers up to the current window
#  %+w     all window numbers after the current window
#  %W      all window numbers and names except the current one
#  %y      last two digits of the year number
#  %Y      full year number
#
# Older versions of screen used a single '%' character
# to display window titles - but since version 3.7 this is
# obsoleted by '%n' and it will vanish in future releases.
# So please update your screenrc to meet this convention!
#
# ===============================================================
# "~" stands for the "bell" character
#
# activity              'Activity in window %n' # default
#
# use %n to display the window number and %t for its title:
# activity              "activity in window #%n title: %t~"
#
# activity              "activity in window #%n title: %t~"
#
  activity              "%C -> %n%f %t activity!"
#
# pass on the "beep" (CTRL-G) by adding a '~':
  bell                  "%C -> %n%f %t bell!~"
#
# pow_detach_msg:       Message shown when session
#                       gets power detached.
  pow_detach_msg        "BYE"
#
# vbell_msg:            Message shown when the
#                       "virtual bell" rings.
  vbell_msg             " *beep* "

#  BIND bind - defaults
# ==============================================================
# The "bind" command assign keys to (internal) commands
# SCREEN checks all the keys you type; you type the key
# which is known as the "command character" then SCREEN
# eats this key, too, and checks whether this key is
# "bound" to a command.  If so then SCREEN will execute it.
#
# The command "bind" allows you to chose which keys
# will be assigned to the commands.
#
# Some commands are bound to several keys -
# usually to both some letter and its corresponding
# control key combination, eg the command
# "(create) screen" is bound to both 'c' and '^C'.
#
# The following list shows the default bindings:
#
# break       ^B b
# clear       C
# colon       :
# copy        ^[ [
# detach      ^D d
# digraph     ^V
# displays    *
# dumptermcap .
# fit         F
# flow        ^F f

# ==============================================================
# KEY BINDING FAQ:
# ==============================================================
# FAQ: So many keys are bound to some command already -
#      which keys are unbound yet? Which are free for binding?
# A:   SCREEN does not have a command to show you
#      a table of currently unbound keys - sorry!
#      You simply have to read this setup file. ;-)
#
#      Summary:  Here is a table of the keys
#      which are not bound by default:
#      unbound:  -B--E-G--J-L---P-R-TUV--Y-
#        bound:  A-CD-F-HI-K-MNO-Q-S---WX-Z
#
# I suggest that you do not change the bindings for
# 'H' ("log") and 'M' ("monitor") as they are *really*
# useful and you might want to use them a lot;
# in this case it is recommended to use
# the defaults to avoid confusion.
# personally, I use 'A' ("title") quite often, too.
#
# If you are using "split windows"
# then you will also use the command
# associated with the keys FQSX a lot, too -
# so do not change their bindings, either!
#
# Anyway, I have bound the unbound uppercase letters
# to start programs in windows directly, ie without
# starting a new window with a shell within first.
# This simply saves shells and thus saves RAM -
# and also avoids that the title of windows is
# the name of your shell.  Also, you need not "exit"
# from a shell when you are done with some program.
# And when using "zombie mode" then the window will stay
# and you can resurrect them with the CTRL-SPACE command.
# cool! :-)
#
# enable "zombie mode":
# zombie z
# here the parameter 'z' defines the key
# which makes a zombie window go away.
#
#
# ==============================================================
# BIND and the Services:
# ==============================================================
# I am using the uppercase letters to start programs/services:
#
## bind K  kill # default!
   bind K
   bind h
   bind H
   bind X lockscreen
# This *removes* the binding for 'K'
# thus requireing you to enter the
# command via the command line, ie ":kill".
# This prevent accidental killing of your windows.
# Old versions of SCREEN do not prompt for
# confirmation on "killing a window", you see..
#
# ===============================================================
# BIND Examples:
# ===============================================================
# You can also paste the values of
# SCREEN's environment variables:
# bind E stuff $EMAIL
# bind U stuff $URL
# bind I stuff $ICQ
#
# ===============================================================
# BINDKEY:
# ===============================================================
# [TODO briefly explain the difference between BIND and BINDKEY]
#
# use the PgUp and PgDn keys to enter copy mode
# and page through the window backlog:
#  bindkey -k kP copy
#
# Use the function keys F7 and F8
# to cycle backwards/forwards in
# the list of existing windows:
#  bindkey -k k7 prev
#  bindkey -k k8 next
#
# make the "kb" send a backspace (CTRL-H:)
# bindkey -d kb stuff ^H
# WARNING:  this does not work as advertised.
# it eats the "kb" when typing "dankbar" for example. :-(
#
# NumPad keybindings:
# ^[Oo /      resize =
# ^[Oj *      resize max
# ^[Om -      resize -2
